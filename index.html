											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I am a 4th Year PhD candidate in the Astronomy Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, being advised by <a href= "https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Brad.Cenko/Brad_Cenkos_NASA_HomePage/Home.html">Brad Cenko</a>. My research focuses on understanding astrophysical transients
										from an observational perspective. I utilize ground and space-based telescopes to paint a multi-wavelength, panchromatic picture of some of the most explosive and energetic explosions in the Universe. You can find my recent work on NASA ADS <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/ttsHfc6HT0mcB1DNo7kvWg">here</a>. </p>
										<p>I obtained my B.S. in Astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology in 2021, where I completed a senior thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mansi/">Mansi Kasliwal</a>, titled <a href = "files/Senior_Thesis.pdf">"Using Palomar Gattini-IR to study Core-collapse Supernovae and Probe their Red Supergiant Progenitors"</a>. You can find a copy of my full CV <a href="files/Astro_CV_2023.pdf">here</a>. </p>
										<p> With regards to my future goals, I plan to continue doing research as a post-doctoral scholar after I obtain my PhD (planned for 2026), and then ultimately strive to become a Professor of Astrophysics. When not doing research, you will probably find me on the basketball court. I played at the <a href = "https://gocaltech.com/news/2020/11/17/11_17_2020_717.aspx"> collegiate level</a>, and plan to continue being involved in basketball through coaching in the future.

										<h3>Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</h3>
										<p>Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are short-lived flashes of gamma-rays that originate from black holes and neutron stars left over after a massive stellar collapse, that are characterized by jets moving extremely close to the speed of light. These bursts release more energy in a couple of seconds than the Sun will in its entire lifetime, and are playgrounds for physics at the most extreme levels.  </p>

										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/CCSNe.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Stripped-envelope Core-Collapse Supernovae</h3>
										<p>Core-collapse supernovae are explosions (CCSNe) that represent the end of a massive star's life, and end with the creation of a neutron star or black hole. CCSNe enrich the universe with heavy elements, and are prime sites for understanding a plethora of different astrophysical processes. Stripped-envelope CCSNe have had their progenitor stars stripped of their Hydrogen and Helium outer envelopes prior to stellar collapse, most likely due to stellar winds or the presence of a binary companion. A particular class of stripped-envelope CCSNe (Type Ic-BL SNe) are associated with LGRBs.</p>
									</li>
								
								</ul>
								My PhD research is on understanding relativistic transients that originate from massive stellar deaths. A particular class of GRBs known as Long GRBs are known to originate from the collapse of massive stars, and there have been numerous confirmations of associated Type Ic-BL SNe to Long GRBs that are close enough such that supernova emission is detectable. However, many open questions remain: the majority of Type Ic-BL SNe do not produce accompanying LGRBs, there have been instances of nearby LGRBs where supernova emission has been ruled out, and the physical relationship between CCSNe and LGRBs in GRB-SN systems is still unclear. Furthermore, a broad range of relativistic transients not associated with a gamma-ray trigger also exist, known as "orphan afterglows". The physical origin for these transients found independently of gamma-ray triggers is still unclear. In addition, a new myseterious class of luminous, fast-fading, blue transients known as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) also have emerged, which can posssess realtivistic ejecta and also likely have massive stellar death origins. Therefore, it is clear that the landscape of relativistic stellar explosions is diverse, complex, and begging for exploration. In my PhD research, I study different aspects of the continuum of relativistic stellar explosions, utilizing observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to shed light on the diversity of massive stellar deaths and relativistic jets. Below is a list of my publications.

										<h3>Cosmos Crusaders Podcast</h3>
										<p>I am a co-creator of Cosmos Crusaders, a podcast that highlights the stories and achievements of minorities and underrepresented individuals in astrophysics. We have highlighted members in the astrophysics community spanning from graduate students to tenured faculty, from a diverse set of ethnicities, identities, and backgrounds, in hopes of making the astrophysics field a more inclusive and diverse space for future generations. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cosmoscrusaders6230/featured">Here</a> is our Youtube link.</p>

										<h3>UMD Astronomy EDI Commitee</h3>
										<p>I am an active member of the UMD Astronomy EDI commitee, and implemented the Department's first ever mentoring program between graduate students and senior undergraduate Astronomy majors. The program is in its inagural year, and I hope to lay the infrastructure for the program enough so that it continues after I have left UMD. <a href="https://www.astro.umd.edu/EDI/EDICommittee.html">Here</a> is a link to the EDI commitee's website. </p>

										<h3>AMAZN HQ</h3>
										<p>AMAZN is short for "Amazingly Asian", and is an organization that spotlights Asian American athletes, a demographic that is often overlooked, stereotyped, and misrepresented in the mainstream media when it comes to athletics. I volunteer with AMAZN, and am helping them organize future events that will shine the spotlight on the next generation of Asian American hoopers. <a href="https://amaznhq.com/">Here</a> is a link to their website.</p>
