											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I am a 4th Year PhD candidate in the Astronomy Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, being advised by <a href= "https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Brad.Cenko/Brad_Cenkos_NASA_HomePage/Home.html">Dr. Brad Cenko</a>. My research focuses on understanding astrophysical transients
										from an observational perspective. I utilize ground and space-based telescopes to paint a multi-wavelength, panchromatic picture of some of the most explosive and energetic explosions in the Universe. </p>
										<p>I obtained my B.S. in Astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology in 2021, where I completed a senior thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mansi/">Prof. Mansi Kasliwal</a>, titled <a href = "files/Senior_Thesis.pdf">"Using Palomar Gattini-IR to study Core-collapse Supernovae and Probe their Red Supergiant Progenitors"</a>. <strong>You can find a copy of my full CV <a href="files/Gokul_Srinivasaragavan__CV_-3.pdf">here</a></strong>. </p>
										<p> I will be a visiting graduate student at the California Institute of Technology during the 2025-2026 academic year, and plan to defend my dissertation in May 2026. I plan to continue doing research as a post-doctoral scholar after I obtain my PhD, and then ultimately become a Professor of Astrophysics. When not doing research, you will probably find me on the basketball court. I played at the <a href = "https://gocaltech.com/news/2020/11/17/11_17_2020_717.aspx"> collegiate level</a>, and plan to continue being involved in basketball through coaching in the future.

										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/GRB.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</h3>
										<p>Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) are short-lived flashes of gamma-rays that originate from black holes and neutron stars left over after a massive stellar collapse, that are characterized by jets moving extremely close to the speed of light. These bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic phenomena in the Universe and are playgrounds for studying physics at the most extreme levels.  </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/CCSNe.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Core-Collapse Supernovae</h3>
										<p>Core-collapse supernovae are explosions (CCSNe) that represent the end of a massive star's life, and end with the creation of a neutron star or black hole. They are the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, and their studies have far-reaching implications across astrophyiscs. </p>
									</li>
								
								</ul>
								My research focuses on studying LGRBs, CCSNe, and other transients that bridge the gap between these explosive phenomena. Below is a list of my first-authored publications. A full list can be found on NASA ADS <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/ttsHfc6HT0mcB1DNo7kvWg">here</a>.

										<h3>Cosmos Crusaders Podcast</h3>
										<p>I am a co-creator of Cosmos Crusaders, a podcast that highlights the stories and achievements of minorities and underrepresented individuals in astrophysics. We have highlighted members in the astrophysics community spanning from graduate students to tenured faculty, from a diverse set of ethnicities, identities, and backgrounds, in hopes of making the astrophysics field a more inclusive and diverse space for future generations. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cosmoscrusaders6230/featured">Here</a> is our Youtube link.</p>

										<h3>UMD Astronomy EDI Commitee</h3>
										<p>I am a member of the UMD Astronomy EDI commitee, and implemented the Department's first ever mentoring program between graduate students and senior undergraduate Astronomy majors. The program is in its third year, and has been very successful. <a href="https://www.astro.umd.edu/EDI/EDICommittee.html">Here</a> is a link to the EDI commitee's website. </p>

										<h3>AMAZN HQ</h3>
										<p>AMAZN is short for "Amazingly Asian", and is an organization that spotlights Asian American athletes, a demographic that is often overlooked, stereotyped, and misrepresented in the mainstream media when it comes to athletics. I volunteer with AMAZN, and am helping them organize future events that will shine the spotlight on the next generation of Asian American hoopers. <a href="https://amaznhq.com/">Here</a> is a link to their website.</p>
